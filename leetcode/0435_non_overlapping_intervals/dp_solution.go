/*
435. Non-overlapping Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:
	1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
	2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
