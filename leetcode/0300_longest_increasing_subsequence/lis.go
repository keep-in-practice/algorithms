/*
300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up:
	Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
