# [Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

## Description
>Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
>
>Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
>
>The result can be in any order.
